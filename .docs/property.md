# Property API - API SLUZÌŒBY MAJETEK

This API allows you to check information about which is then converted to adequate entity:
 - `lands` (parcely) -> `Entity\Property\Land`
 - `buildings` (budovy) -> `Entity\Property\Building`
 - `building units` (jednotky) -> `Entity\Property\BuildingUnit`
 - `persons` (osoby) -> `Entity\Property\Person`

For each of entities above the special client class with corresponding public methods is created.

- `src/Client/Property/LandClient.php`
- `src/Client/Property/BuildingClient.php`
- `src/Client/Property/BuildingUnitClient.php`
- `src/Client/Property/PersonClient.php`

Just pass a valid `token` to Client class constructor and you are ready to go.

Except entites above the `Entity\Property\Ownership` (details about owners, their shares etc) and `Entity\Property\Sentence` (objects legal sentences) entities exist.
